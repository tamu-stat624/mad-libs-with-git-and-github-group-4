Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear JOHN,

I am writing to you from an AMBITIOUS spaceship in an ADVENTUROUS galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a white rocket in AUGUST. There are 3 DOGS and LIONS of BRUCE here! In the
GROOM there is a pool full of MERCURY. I fall asleep each night on a SCARY bed of
COTTON and dream of BIKING CAUTIOUSLY. It feels as though I have lived here for
36 [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
