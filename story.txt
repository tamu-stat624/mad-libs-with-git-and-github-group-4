Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear JOHN,

I am writing to you from an AMBITIOUS spaceship in an ADVENTUROUS galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a white rocket in AUGUST. There are 3 DOGS and LIONS of BRUCE here! In the
GROOM there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] HOURS. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
SWIMMING on a LARGE JEEP!!

Best wishes,
YADHU
